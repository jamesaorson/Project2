public class Gcd {
    //For my GCD solution, I chose to use Euclid's algorithm. The idea behind
    //this algorithm is that any divisor common to x and y can divide
    //the remainder of x and y. So if modulus returns 0, y must have been
    //the GCD. If not, then we swap y to the front (also allowing either x or y
    //to be the larger of the two), and pass in the remainder of x and y to
    //a recursive call of the function.
